short explanation of how you used pointers, const, references, casting, exceptions, and control flow.

- In this homework assignment, the goal was to store names and GPAs in two parallel arrays of size capacity. 

- I used const to keep the variable values consistent and the same when using them in different arrays and functions, so that they wouldn't change unless I set them to a different value later. 

-  I used pointers to store names dynamically using new char[], and also to update a student's GPA with a pointer to a double.

- I used Casting to let me convert a decimal GPA to a whole number just for display.

- I used Exceptions to let me deal with errors without crashing the program.

- I used Control flow in the program decides what to do based on user input. The switch made it easy to handle different menu options.

- A reference is like a nickname for the real variable, so when you change it inside the function, it also changes in main().
